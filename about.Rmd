## About Me
Hi, my name is **Tejas Mundhe** and I am an incoming freshman at Walnut Hills High School. I enjoy playing soccer and swimming as well as computer science.

## About the Project
The *Car-Plot* project is a scatter plot of the miles per gallon(fuel efficiency) of vehicles by their weight. A linear trend line is also drawn to summarize the relationship that heavier vehicles are less fuel efficient than others.

### Goals
* Display how heavier cars are much less environmentally friendly than lighter ones
  + Multiple different arguments required to make the trend line
* Produce a clean looking plot with my R skills
